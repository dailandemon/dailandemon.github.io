### Professional Self-Assesment 

   During the Computer Science Program at SNHU and the previous 5 years of studying different areas by my own I have obtained several skills and experiences that made me grow. My initial interest was related to video game development, so I was trying to learn from the different disciplines that make up that area and learning some general basic knowledge that serve as foundation for future skills.
	
   In the game development I started to learn how to program in different languages, which include C#, C++, and Java. I started to practice using the Unity Engine for it. Then I learned to use Blender and learned 3D modeling and sculpting together with graphic design and techniques to improve the artistic side of it. At the same time in the Computer Science Program I had learned the general concepts behind Agile Development, and more General Knowledge like Physics classes which I would latter use in the Unity Engine to simulate realistic physics and destruction, specially particle physics with the tools Unity provides.
	
   During the middle of the Computer Science Program I started to have more complex classes, I learned several practices related to Databases with SQL and NoSQL with MongoDB. During the same time I came upon GCP(Google Cloud Platform) since my stepfather who is a developer started studying it and certificated himself in it, I saw the huge power and versatility of Cloud computing and development and started studying to also certify myself in GCP. Because of this I learned some network security, big data, and analytics. Also, in the Computer Science program I learned a bit of Python when making REST APIs for MongoDB.
	
   Recently what I have interacted with a lot have been mobile and web development, I have been working making React JS components for web applications for a company and with Flutter and React Native for mobile applications as freelance. Also, the Computer Science program finale had a few android development classes where I got to practice more my Java skills and learn to use the native android language, but after using Flutter for a while and learning a lot of ways of making different things for mobile and web, I find the classes to be lacking and outdated. The Artifact I plan to display ahead is one of the first Flutter apps I made, a simple administration app but in terms of ease of development compared to native Java the speed at which one can develop high quality apps with it is amazing, and the same codebase works in both iOS and Android with very little cost to performance which is a plus.
